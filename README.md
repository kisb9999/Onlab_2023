# Onlab_2023

In this project I use a smart IoT board developed by Endrich. This board collects temperature and ambient light data and sends them to a cloud service. 
I get the data from this servis through an API call made from an Android application. This application then insert these data into wto different chart: one for the temperature, the other or the ambient light.

# Folders

- Onlab_2023_Board: contains the source code for the IoT board
- Onlabor_2023_Android: contains the Android Studio project where the data is displayed
